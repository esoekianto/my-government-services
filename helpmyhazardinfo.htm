        <h1>Online Help:</h1>
	    <p>The <b>My Hazard Information</b> application helps residents discover hazards that exist in their community and obtain information about evacuation routes and shelters provided by a government agency. My Hazard Information is a single application that can be deployed by local governments and used by citizens on a desktop PC, mobile phone, and tablet device.</p>
	    <h4><u>Using the Application</u></h4>
	    <p>The My Hazard Information application offers a simple way for residents to locate hazards and information about government facilities important during a natural or manmade disaster. To locate an area of interest, simply enter an address in the search box, or use your current location. Your location will then be highlighted on the map and relevant evacuation and facility information will be presented to the user.  </p>
        <h4><u>Finding an Area of Interest</u></h4>
        <p>There are three primary ways to identify an area of interest. You can interact directly with the map and click on a address when you've located it. You can also use your current location or finally search for an address to find hazards and facilities.</p>
        <h4><u>Map Based Navigation</u></h4>
        <p>There are several ways to interact with the map:<br /><br />1. Use the basemap switcher to select the basemap you'd like to interact with<br />2. Hold down the shift key and drag a box on the map to zoom in<br />3. Hold Down Ctrl+Shift to zoom out<br />4. Roll your mouse roller to zoom in/out<br />5. Drag the zoom slider to zoom in/out</p>
        <h4><u>Searching</u></h4>
        <p>The search box can be used to find an address:<br /><br />1. Enter the address you're interested in<br />2. Click on the item in the list to locate the address on the map</p>
        <h4><u>Hazard and Facility Information</u></h4>
        <p>After searching for a respective address, relevant hazard and facility information will be presented in the bottom of the application. In addition, you'll also find a list of the closest government facilities and directions to each.<br /></p>
        <h4><u>Directions</u></h4>
        <p>You can also get directions to each facility using your current location or an address you select. When you find a government facility you'd like to visit, click the Direction button, to calculate the directions and route.</p>
        <h4><u>Share Your Map</u></h4>
        <p>You can click on the Share Map button to share your map several different ways.  You can compose an email, post to your Facebook wall or post a Tweet. When you use the Facebook or Twitter links, you'll be asked to sign in to your respective account.</p>
        <h4><u>More Information</u></h4>
        <p>The <b>My Hazard Information</b> application can used by emergency management, police departments, fire departments, or other local government organizations responsible for delivering hazard and facility information to the general public. This application provides 24x7 access to the organization and typically supplements customer service phone numbers staffed by these organizations.<br /><br />Please visit Esri's ArcGIS for Local Government Resource Center for additional information.<br/></p>
